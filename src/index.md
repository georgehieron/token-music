Token Music Guitar and Vocal Tuition offers private one on one music tuition as well as group sessions. Covering a mix of genres and styles, from ages 6 and up, beginners to advanced, everyone and every ability welcome!

I offer competitive rates for guitar, vocal, bass, keyboard, song writing, music theory and ukulele tuition, and students who book in for ongoing lessons will receive their very own music book at no extra cost, which can be personalised and added to at each lesson. To make Token Music Tuition even more accessible to you, I can come to you so you can enjoy the lessons in the comfort of your own home.

Token Music also offers general guitar maintenance, restringing and cleaning.
