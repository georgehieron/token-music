For block lessons of six, all sessions must be taken within ten weeks of the first session.

For students under the age of 18, there must be an adult/parent/carer present in the home throughout each lesson.

There is a cancellation notice period of 24 hours. Any cancelled/rearranged lessons within 24 hours of booked sessions will be charged as one lesson. This is for both 30 minute and one hour sessions.

Where one student cancels, a group session will still go ahead for the rest of the group. The cancellation won't be charged if over 24 hours notice is given.

If for some reason, I am unfortunately not able to attend a lesson, I will endeavour to give as much notice as possible. I will always offer an alternative date and time, or happily add the missed lesson to the end of the six sessions. In cases of one-off lessons, I will of course offer a new date and time, or a full refund for that one-off session.
